# ML_Project1
project1 source code for course on ML

This project involves calculating following for a university data  
1)mean  
2)variance  
3)standard deviation
4)covariance matrix(a 4x4 matrix)  
5)correlation matrix(a 4x4 matrix)  
6)Maximum Likelihood Estimation values considering normal distribution for underlying data
7)Also built a bayesian network with a log likelihood probability greater then the one obtained
   considering variables as independent
